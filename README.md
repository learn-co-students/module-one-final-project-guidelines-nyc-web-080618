Welcome to our game.
By design, this game is extremely intuitive and therefore requires little in the way of explanation. It's fun for a player to experiment with the game mechanics and discover how the game works.

Broadly, the player should complete quests in order to increase his attack power. After enhancing his skills, the player can then fight other characters that have been created by other users. Any character that is created (and still alive) can be accessed at a later date if the user wants to continue his progress.


To play the game for the first time:

Initialize the tables
rake db:migrate

Seed the data
rake db:seed

To run the game:
ruby bin/run.rb



This project uses many gems from outside sources. Specifically, the "faker" gem was of great help to us. All rights reserved and retained by the creators of these applications.


This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are products of the authorÂ’s imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.


Thanks for playing,
